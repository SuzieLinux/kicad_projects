This board is a USB to J1708, it is used for the old J1587 serial protocol
still used in the military and for some old vehicles.

I used it to debug a military project which had obsolete parts and the only
test available was on Windows 95 and the J1587 tool I was using died when I
was doing a job in Montréal for a Québec automotive customer.
My employer was not willing to buy me a new tool and I wasn't interested in
run and crash method for debugging so I created my own tool on a weekend.
It took about a week to get the boards from seeedstudio.
The tool that died cost around $3000 and is no longer available for
purchase.

I wrote the test in Pascal.
I will create a linux app to communicate with it likely in C++ and maybe in
pascal, depending on my mood at the time. Developing with Lazarus is hard
to beat by any C or C++ tool.

I am retired. I had offered to sell my employer this but they said that I
was not an approved source.

Funny thing is that the alernative will cost them around $12000 where I was
willing to sell my board with software for less than a couple of hundred
dollars. 

Feel free to use the tool but if you are going to make money with it be
nice enough to make a donation on my website.

This project was created with version 7, I reloaded with version 8 and saved it.

I made no change so it should still work as is.
