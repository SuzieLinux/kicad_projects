This board can use a RL78 G14 or G24, G24 is a newer device which is pin
compatible but uses a different program for configuration

The G14 uses applilet3 and the G24 uses the smart configurator.

I have not tested this board yet but it should work as it is based on other
working boards. If I find issues when I receive the boards I will make an
update to the design

The board runs at 3.3V.
The LCD is Chanruida 1.8 inch TFT LCD 128 Ã— 160 color screen 
ST7735 SPI display LCD module with SD card slot arduino display display lcd

The ethernet adapter is a small board called W5500 SPI to LAN ethernet
network module

The keypad is a 4x5 keypad

The debugger used is E2 Lite. I have an adapter so you can connect the
debugger to it.

Feel free to use this board but if you are going to make money with it be
nice enough to make a donation on my website.
