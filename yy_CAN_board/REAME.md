This board uses a MCP2517FD or MCP2518FD
It was meant to use with my youyeetoo boards but it can be used with any
board that provides SPI port and GPIOs.

It is +3.V only board. I designed it in 2023 using the version 6 or 7. I
saved it as version 8 but didn't change the schematic.

The schematic calls for a 16Mhz xtal but I actually use a 4Mhz xtal. 

Feel free to use this board but if you are going to make money with it be
nice enough to make a donation on my website.
