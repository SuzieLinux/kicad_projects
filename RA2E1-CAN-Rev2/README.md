This board uses Renesas R7FA2E1A93 Arm Cortex-M23 device

This is work in progress. I need to test with the evaluation board before I
finalize the design and order boards.

The LCD is Chanruida 1.8 inch TFT LCD 128 Ã— 160 color screen 
ST7735 SPI display LCD module with SD card slot arduino display display lcd

The ethernet adapter is a small board called W5500 SPI to LAN ethernet
network module

It uses a MC2518FD CAN FD device

The debugger used is E2 Lite.

Feel free to use this board but if you are going to make money with it be
nice enough to make a donation on my website.
